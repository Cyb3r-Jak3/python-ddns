# Python-DDNS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jwhite1st/python-ddns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jwhite1st/python-ddns)

This is program written in python that acts as a DDNS client, currently just for Cloudflare.  
Works on python3 and up.  

I plan on making it a ppa to have it easier to update.

## To use

```bash
pip install -r requirements
# To test configuration
python3 python-ddns.py
```
